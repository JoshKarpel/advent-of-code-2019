# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).

Solutions for each day are organized into directories based on language (possibly with additional support files).
Each day's script is runnable as a standalone script.
The run scripts in the repository root can be used to run solutions conveniently (e.g., `rb 01` to run the Ruby solution for day 1).
Any inputs provided by AoC are stored in `data/`.
